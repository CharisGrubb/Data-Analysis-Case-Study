## Context
Yelp was founded in 2004 to help people find great local businesses. Today, the website and their mobile application publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses as well as certain metadata about them that can help in customer's decision-making process. Yelp uses automated software to recommend the most helpful and reliable reviews for the Yelp community from such a large and diverse dataset.

The Yelp dataset is a large collection of user reviews, business metadata, business check-ins, users' social network data, user tips for businesses across 10 cities spread across 4 countries. The original dataset is very huge with ~ 11GB of data. In this case study, we will only use a subset of data due to the hardware limitations.


## Dataset

Out of many attributes available in the yelp_reviews data, we will only use the following four attributes:
